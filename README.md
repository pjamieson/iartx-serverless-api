# iartx-serverless-api

A Node.js-based backend for both an Online Art Gallery application and a mobile app. Together, the clients and this backend employ eight Amazon Web Services: S3, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Certificate Manager, CloudFront, and Route53.

## Introduction

This project is an extension of the backend half of the excellent [Serverless Stack Tutorial]https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com by AnomalyInnovations. That tutorial, in turn, leverages the [Serverless Framework]https://serverless.com/ to generate AWS API Gateway endpoints and Lambda functions based on the code in this project.

Additional details coming soon....
